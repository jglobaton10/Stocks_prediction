# Stocks_prediction

The objective of this project was to create a web app that allow the users to  know the best stocks of the week and how they are in comparison with the last week, compare stocks based on the user choice and predict prices of the stocks that the user choose, using Long short term memory (LSTM) networks . In particular, the user can analyze a stock from  three different angles its close price, low price and high price. The app was built using Streamlit (simple web app framework for analytics and machine learning apps), Flask, pandas, yfinance, keras, scikit-learn and numpy. The web app is conformed by two files:

1. [streamlit_app.py)[https://github.com/jglobaton10/Stocks_prediction/blob/main/streamlit_app.py]: This is the web app itself, it is a mix of front end and back end. Here the user can see the best stocks and compare stocks. Also, this script makes requests and show the prices of the predicted stocks.
